Project2_Graphs:

Question 3 and Question 4:
Implementation of undirectedGraph class, directedGraph class, GraphSearch class , and TopSort class can be found in Graph.h
GraphSearch class--> includes functions such as depth firt search, and breadth first traversal. 
TopSort class--> includes Kahn's algorithm and modifiedDFS algorithm implementations
All other functions required for creating undirected and directed graphs and a linked list, and the code required for testing can be found in main.cpp

Question 5:
Implementation of all classes and functions required in question 5; WeightedGraph class, creating complete weighted graph functions, Dijkstra’s function and the code for testing, can be found in Q5_Dijkstras.cpp

Question 6:
Implementation of all classes and functions required in question 6 ; GridGraph class, creating grid Graph function, Astar function and the code for testing, can be found in Q6_Astar.cpp
